# My neovim config

## The Goals

- Efficiency, the main goal for my editor is being able to do anything I want in the shortest amount of keystrokes
- Looks, I want my editor to look amazing while I use it
- Modular, I want to be able to configure my editor without having to re-learn where everything is
- Update-safe, I dont want my editor breaking just because some random plugin decided to change a minor thing [xkcd.com/2347](https://xkcd.com/2347/)
